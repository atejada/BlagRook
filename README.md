<h2>Rook on Heroku with graphic capabilities</h2>

<h3>Acknowledgement</h3>
I started by looking at this two awesome projects on Github rookonheroku (https://github.com/noahhl/rookonheroku) 
and heroku-buildpack-r-build-r (https://gist.github.com/virtualstaticvoid/6104311) I took some chips from both 
and then create my own script and stepsâ€¦
